I’m a PhD student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Kevin Jamieson](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jamieson). I work broadly on the theory of machine learning and algorithms for decision-making under uncertainty. Previously, I graduated in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology, and my undergraduate thesis was advised by [Salman Beigi](https://salmanbeigi.github.io/).
